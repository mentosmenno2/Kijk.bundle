# Plex KIJK plugin 2.0

Welcome! This plugin is a tool to watch missed episodes from the Dutch TV channels owned by the SBS Broadcasting company. These channels are SBS6, Veronica, NET5 and SBS9.

## Old plugins

This plug-in is an edited copy of the unofficial KIJK plug-in found [here](https://github.com/yutzhead/Kijk.bundle).
There is also a newer version just available, however at the time of writing it doesn't work yet: [view it here](https://github.com/alexvandervegt/Kijk.bundle).
